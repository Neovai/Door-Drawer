The drawer_data_collection and door_data_collection was used to collect data from the Door and Drawer with a python script (not main code). 
The Door_code and Drawer_code have UI's that use the Arduino IDE and are only for tetsing the Door/Drawer through the arduino.
Door_ros and Drawer_ros are the final versions of the code that is used for interfacing with ros.
